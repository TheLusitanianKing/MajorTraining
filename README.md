# Major's Circuit Training [![Tests](https://github.com/TheLusitanianKing/MajorTraining/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TheLusitanianKing/MajorTraining/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

Inspired by the [circuit training of French Foreign Legion's Major Michiara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcitMZdgYIA), here is a very simple circuit training generator to plan yours with nothing but your terminal.

## Usage
A simple `cabal run major` should be enough.
